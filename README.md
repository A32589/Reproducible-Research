# Reproducible research
The data for the analysis is sourced from a personal activity monitoring device. This device collects data at 5 minute intervals through out the day. The data consists of two months of data from an anonymous individual collected during the months of October and November in 2012. The data is available here. 


The variables included in the data are:

steps: Number of steps taken in a 5-minute interval
date: The date on which the measurement was taken in YYYY-MM-DD format
interval: A unuiqe identifier for the 5-minute interval in which measurement was taken
Missing values are coded as "NA". The dataset contains 17,568 observations and is stored in a comma-sperated value (CSV) format.

## Report
The following sections need to be present in the report:

* Loading and processing the data
* The mean total number of steps taken per day
* Daily patterns
* Comparing daily patterns with daily patterns where missing values are imputed
* Comparing differences between weekdays and weekends in daily patterns
* The report needs to be saved in a R Markdown format (.Rmd) and commited to a GitHub repository. The Markdown and HTML files resulting from using the knit2html() function need to be submitted as well.
